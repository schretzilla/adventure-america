                            the unique opportunity to pioneer UPMC's new Rotaional Engineering position. The position required the employee to be placed in a different division
                            throughout the company every six months. It kept me on my toes as I worked across a wide stack of different technologies and at the conclusion

                            considered nonessential then I packed my small 2001 Toyota Celica with everything left and said goodbye to my Pittsburgh friends. I didn't
                            know for sure where I was going so I was flyin by the seat of my pants as I drove West.

I met some very interesting people in this hostel including the hostel owners, some avid petitioners and one very sweet porch cat.

                            It turns out that Samaritan’s Purse is a pretty awesome volunteer organization that organizes volunteer groups during times of national crises. For floods we went to houses and did mud outs. This basically means we remove everything from the house that was contaminated by the floodwater. It’s hard work ripping out floor and crawling under houses but it was all worth it to help out some very grateful families.

Since I was already down this far south I put Texas was next on my list. I had been to the state on multiple occasions for national wrestling tournaments and one Ironman competition but I was always so busy that I never really had the chance to explore. Despite my gut feelings as an Eagles fan I made my way towards Dallas.

                            So my day started off at 4:30am when I got locked out of my Air BnB. I took that as a sign that I should get my day started early. I went through my normal routine as I got on my bike to explore downtown. Here I found some very pretty sights like Thanks Giving Square.

                            While I was downtown I searched around for things going on in Dallas and I came across a rugby team that plays every Sunday. I’ve never played rugby before but I’d also never been a nomad before so I figured I’d give it a shot. I quickly googled the rules to Rugby so I wasn’t completely blind going into it then I showed up early so I could be placed on a team. With rugby’s non-stop running and extreme contact it’s exactly what I look for in a sport. It went so well that an event I thought would only take a few hours ended up turning into the entire day. After the game I hung with the team for a cookout as we chatted it up. I made some good friends that day and I’m now inspired to play rugby.

                What happens next kind of sets the stage for how I operated for the rest of my trip. Some of the rugby players mentioned that they had seen some pretty cool stuff in South Dakota. Inspired by some of the places mentioned by them I decided to free myself from any of my plans to immediately head west and instead just go wherever the people I met suggested. I had never been to South Dakota before and I knew cold weather was going to be coming in so it was best to get to the colder locations sooner rather than later. It was a long drive and involved two nights of camping to get to my next location.

                            The climbing group meeting there was celebrating the quickly approaching Halloween. The idea was that they would dress in costumes then climb the spires with pumpkins attached them. Once at the top they carved the pumpkin and put their headlamps inside it to allow the jack-o’-lantern to safely glow all night. What an awesome idea!

Some of the climbers invited myself and the other campers to a Halloween celebration they were having at a cavers house. The person who lived at the house was a spelunker throughout Wind Cave. In the spirit of their profession they built a cardboard tunnel maze / house of terror in their garage. It was an extremely clever use of resources and surprisingly spooky to go through. Although I really enjoyed hanging with my new friends it had also inspired me to hanging do some more intense climbing and the Colorado Rockies were calling my name.

Our timing seemed to be on point to as we got as that night there was a supper moon that we got to watch rise over the canyon.

A ride like that could be done rather comfortably in 6 or 7 days so I figured I’d do it in 4. Without much time to prepare I parked my car and set out on my bike into San Diego on bike.

Then in the middle of the night my bike started to make some alarming noises. After some inspection it turns out that 2 out of the 5 of screws holding together my drive were missing. The next closest place for parts was more than 100 miles away so I had little choice but to keep on going and hope for the best. I road on for another day using the view to distract me from my pragmatic situation.

Considering everything I wanted to do involved being outside I would say this messed with our plans a bit. Basically while we were in Austin we tried a bunch of different food around the city attempting to wait out the cold.

With my journey across the country finally concluded I had time to rethink a few things. If I had the opportunity would I make the same decision? The answer is yes, in a heartbeat. I went out on a limb and flew by the seat of my pants for a months and it was unpredictable and enjoyable. There were ups and downs throughout the trip but choosing to take this opportunity to travel across the country for half a year is an experience I don’t regret. Now all that being said, although all my traveling was an unforgettable experience that allowed me to form life long friendships and memories it was nice to have a warm bed to sleep for a bit.
