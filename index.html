                            It’s August 2016, and I’m on my way to my last presentation at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Throughout my two years working here, I had the unique opportunity to pioneer UPMC's new Rotational Engineering position. As a rotational employee I was required to move to a different team, in a different department, every six months. At this point I had successfully moved across four different teams, lead multiple projects, worked across a wide stack of different technologies and concluded the rotational program. Successful completion of the program left me with the choice of which team I’d like to join as I continued my career. Although the MyUPMC team had some promising projects on the horizon, ideas of travel and adventure filled my mind.

						<h1>So I left my job...</h1>

						<p class="lead"> 
                            It wasn't an easy decision to leave a stable job in favor of a significantly less stable cross-country adventure. However, after talking to many experienced coworkers and friends it became clear to me that the fears of what might happen if I left were trumped by the inevitable feeling of regret that would develop if I stayed. I sold or gave away everything I considered nonessential, then I packed my small 2001 Toyota Celica with everything left and said goodbye to my Pittsburgh friends. I wasn’t sure exactly where I was going so I was flying by the seat of my pants as I drove west.

                            Chicago was the first stop on my journey.

Thankfully my good friend Will was more than willing to take time out of his day to show me some of the hip spots.

Nick informed me that him and his friends are heading to Milwaukee for a Brewers game so on the way to Madison I stopped to cheer on the Pittsburgh Pirates.

While I was here I took advantage of the farmers market that occured every weekend surrounding the capital building. It was the best place to fill up on fresh vegetables and cheese of course.

While I was there I met some very interesting characters including the hostel owners, some avid petitioners and one very sweet porch cat.

                            It turns out that Samaritan’s Purse is a pretty awesome volunteer organization that arranges volunteer groups during times of national crises. In flood situations the objective was to go on site to victims' houses and do 'mud outs.' This basically means we remove everything from the house that was contaminated by the floodwater. It’s hard work ripping out floor and crawling under houses but it was all worth it to help out some very grateful families.

Since I was already down this far south I put Texas next on my list. I had been to the state on multiple occasions for national wrestling tournaments and one Ironman competition but I was always so busy that I never really had the chance to explore. Despite my gut feelings as an Eagles fan I made my way towards Dallas.

                            So my first day in Dallas started off at 4:30am when I got locked out of my Air BnB. I took that as a sign that I should get my day started early. Almost by instinct, I got on my bike to explore downtown. Here I found some very pretty sights like Thanks Giving Square.

                           While I was downtown I searched around for things going on in Dallas and I came across a rugby team that plays every Sunday. I’ve never played rugby before but I’d also never been a nomad before this trip, so I figured I’d give it a shot. I quickly googled the rules to Rugby so I wasn’t completely blind going into it, then I showed up early so I could be placed on a team. With rugby’s non-stop running and extreme contact it’s exactly what I look for in a sport. It went so well that an event I thought would only take a few hours ended up turning into an all day thing. After the game I hung with the team for a cookout as we chatted it up. I made some good friends that day and I’m now inspired to pickup the sport.

                            What happens next kind of sets the stage for how I operated for the rest of my trip. Some of the rugby players mentioned that they had seen some pretty cool stuff in South Dakota. Inspired by some of the places mentioned by them I decided to free myself from any of my plans to immediately head west and instead just go wherever the people I met suggested. I had never been to South Dakota before and I knew cold weather was going to be coming in soon, so it was best to get to the northern locations sooner rather than later. It was a long drive and involved two nights of camping to get to my next location.

The idea was that they would dress in costumes then climb the spires with pumpkins attached them. Once at the top, they carved the pumpkin and put their headlamps inside it to allow the jack-o’-lantern to safely glow all night. It was an awesome idea!

The person who lived at the house was a spelunker throughout Wind Cave. In the spirit of their profession they built a cardboard tunnel maze / house of terror in their garage. It was an extremely clever use of resources and surprisingly spooky to go through. Although I really enjoyed hanging with my new friends it had also inspired me to hanging do some more intense climbing and the Colorado Rockies were calling my name.

Our timing seemed to be on point to as we got as that night there was a supper moon that we got to watch rise over the canyon.

A ride like that could be done rather comfortably in 6 or 7 days so I figured I’d do it in 4. Without much time to prepare I parked my car and set out on my bike into San Diego on bike.

Then in the middle of the night my bike started to make some alarming noises. After some inspection it turns out that 2 out of the 5 of screws holding together my drive were missing. The next closest place for parts was more than 100 miles away so I had little choice but to keep on going and hope for the best. I road on for another day using the view to distract me from my pragmatic situation.

                            After my failed bike attempt in California I knew I had to watch my limits… however halfway down the South Kaibab Trail I realized I’d be done way too early if I turned back now. So despite the signs warning I decided to knock out both trails in one day by hiking the rest of the way down to the Colorado River and back up Bright Angel Trail.

                            Conveniently close to Guadalupe Peak is Carlsbad Caverns. If you don’t know what this is then you NEED to look them up and plan a visit because photos just don’t do it justice. Essentially it’s a huge cavern chain 700 feet below the surface that presents breath-taking scenery for all visitors. When I arrived it was 4pm and the park rangers informed me the last elevator down to the caverns is at 3:30. I looked at my watch and frowned. “Rats, I just missed it” I said.  The park ranger laughed, “Sweetie your using the wrong time zone, it’s only 3pm.” How lucky was I! I had made it just in time to take the last elevator down to the caverns and enjoy the most incredible cave system I have ever seen. To top it off all expenses were covered by my National Park Pass. What a day!

Okay Austin was way too cold. Like I had been in the mountains for a while but something about expecting Texas to be warm and getting hit with that cold front made everything seem way colder. We figured it’d be best to try our luck with the weather in a different city so we made our way east towards New Orleans. The drive was long but we were able to break it up with a fun stop at the Huston Aquarium and one great camping spot.

Blindly following suggestions made by the workers at our hostel we were able to find some very hip spots in New Orleans. It was hard to choose which I enjoyed more, the funky music scene or the chill local dive bars. Thankfully there was no need to decide because both were open all night!                        </p>

    After Chrismas Eve I had some time to sit back and rethink everything that had happened since I left. I'm usually a very calculated person however for the last few months I had managed to step out of my comfort zone fly by the seat of my pants. It was an incredible journey that introduced me to fantastic people and led me places I didn't even know existed. Although there were many ups and downs during my trip, both literally and figuratively, there was not one instance where I regretted my decision journey across the country. I can’t be certain exactly what challenges lie ahead but I know I'm excited for the adventure.
